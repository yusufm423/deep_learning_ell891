Assignment 1:
Q1) aims at implementing our own automatic differentiation engine from scratch.
Q2) aims at implementing fundamental building blocks of convolutional neural networks from scratch which include: Convolutional layer (forward and backward), Max-pooling (forward and backward), kaiming initialization of weights, Batch normalization (forward and backward) and Spatial Batch normalization (forward and backward).
Q3) aims at implementing multihead attention mechanism from scratch for an autoregressive decoder transformer with causal masking and dot-product self-attention.
